# Zabih - mark11 - Check Birthday Lucky App

Created a Vanilla JS App to take input of full Date of Birth and lucky number from User and check if lucky or not by dividing the sum of digits of DOB by lucky number. If remainder=0, then lucky, else not. (This is just for fun, there is no luck in numbers :) )

Technologies used are:
1. HTML
1. CSS
1. JavaScript
